# 6.  File issues

## 6.1  File name

A file with PBN games has extension `.pbn` .

## 6.2  File embedding

A PBN file or a part of it might be embedded in another document, e.g. a HTML file, or a word-processor document.  In order to recognize the PBN text in that document, a set of delimiters can be applied.  The delimiter <PBN> signals the begin of the PBN text, and the delimiter </PBN> signals the end of the PBN text.  (Note, that the characters '<'and '>' are part of the delimiters.) The delimiters do not occur in a PBN file itself.
